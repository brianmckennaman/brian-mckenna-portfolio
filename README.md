# Portfolio Website

The assignment was to create a profile website to provide information about myself, showcase my completed projects and apps, and provide contact information.

First, I created a simple wireframe on Google Slides to provide an outline. Then, I got to work on the html using the semantic outline. Then, I created a style sheet that gave the site visuals, as well as minor interactable elements. 

For an extra touch, I added a simple javasrcipt sheet to add a welcome prompt when the page is loaded.

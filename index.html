            <p class="bio">Welcome to my portfolio page! Here, you may find all of my previous projects, and get a feel for my own sense of style. I wanted to become a programmer because I was looking for a career change. I had been working various jobs in education for several years, but wasn't feeling fulfilled. I always had a passing interest in programming and web design, but never fully took the steps to become one. By becomming a programmer, I am hoping to develop skills to create useful apps and webpages and enter a new and fulfilling career.
